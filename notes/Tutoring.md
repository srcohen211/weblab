* Go to this link, the first result when you Google "UM tutoring": https://camnercenter.miami.edu/tutoring-services/schedule-tutoring-appointment/index.html (This link also has a video on how to register. The system was updated this semester so the video is a bit outdated but still mostly accurate)
* Click the link that says "Click Here" and log into your UM account.
* You should now be on the Navigate homepage. Click the blue "Get Assistance" button on the right.
  * For type of appointment, choose "Tutoring"
  * For service category, choose "Camner Center - Tutoring Appointment"
  * For picking a service, choose "Course-based Tutoring"
* Now you will be asked to choose a location
  * For DAYTIME appointments (9 AM to 5 PM), choose the option that says "UC 2400"
  * For EVENING appointments (5 PM to 10 PM), choose the "Richter Library Learning Commons" option
* Select your desired course, hopefully CIM-111 in this case
* Pick a staff member from the dropdown list (browser autocomplete features sometimes mess this up; if this happens, type a letter and then delete it and it should be fixed)
Click "Next" and you will see a calendar with all my available hours (Remember, depending on the location you chose, you will only see either my daytime or evening hours). Choose one and make an appointment!

### A few notes about making an appointment:
* Tutoring is completely FREE to UM students
* Appointments have to be made at least 24 hours in advance
* Appointments must be cancelled at least 24 hours in advance
* If you make a late cancellation or you do not show up to a scheduled appointment, you will not be able to make any more appointments until you send an email and get approved
